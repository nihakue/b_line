b_line
======

The world's worst GPS app. First, enter your destination. b_line will calculate the shortest route. Good luck following it!
B-Line is an iOS app that I developed as a part of my iOS/software development class freshman year. 
It is in a pretty sorry alpha sort of state right now, and I don't have any real plans to extend it in the immediate future. I think it's a funny idea, though, and would love to see someone play around with it.

Usage
------
I haven't packaged the GoogleMaps.framework files neccesary to run the app. You will need to download
them from google, and put them in the app's root directory.

How to Play
--------
###Load a previous b-line or start a new one
####Loading a game
Lines that you attempt are stored locally, and you can compare you and your friends' runs

####Reach your destination without straying from the line.
The closer you can stay to the line, the more points you'll rack up. If you start to stray from the line, audio queues will warn you.
