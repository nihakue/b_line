b_line
======

The world's worst GPS app. First, enter your destination. b_line will calculate the shortest route. Good luck following it!

Usage
------
There isn't much to it. I have ignored the GoogleMaps.framework files neccesary to run the app. You will need to download
them from google, and put them in the app's root directory.
