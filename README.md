b_line
======

The world's worst GPS app. First, enter your destination. b_line will calculate the shortest route. Good luck following it!
B-Line is an iOS app that I developed as a part of my iOS/software development class at USU. 
It is in a pretty sorry alpha sort of state right now, 
and I don't have any real plans to extend it in the immediate future. 
I think it's a funny idea, though, and would love to see someone play around with it.

Usage
------
There isn't much to it. I have ignored the GoogleMaps.framework files neccesary to run the app. You will need to download
them from google, and put them in the app's root directory.
